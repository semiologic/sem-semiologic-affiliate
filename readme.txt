Automatically adds your affiliate ID to all links to Semiologic.


== Description ==

The Semiologic Affiliate plugin will add your [Semiologic affiliate ID](http://www.semiologic.com/partners/) to links on your site that point to [semiologic.com](http://www.semiologic.com) or [getsemiologic.com](http://www.getsemiologic.com).

Start by signing up with the [Semiologic Affiliate Program](http://www.semiologic.com/partners/), and creating an affiliate campaign.

Then, configure the plugin under Settings / Semiologic Affiliate, by entering your affiliate campaign.

From that point onwards, any link to semiologic.com or getsemiologic.com will now have that ID attached to it.
